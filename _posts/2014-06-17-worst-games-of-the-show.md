title: Worst 5 games of E3
---

Now I’ve given my opinion on the top 5 games from E3 it’s time for me to list the worst 5 games from E3 for me.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge fan of the Battlefield franchise & I have been since Battlefield Bad Company 2. I’ve brought Battlefield Premium for both BF3 & BF4 but something about this game doesn’t click with me. Whilst I think it’s a nice and interesting direction for Battlefield to take it’s too similar too Battlefield 4 & in my opinion could quiet easily be an expansion similar too Battlefield Bad Company 2: Vietnam instead of a full release game.

When the first trailer appeared for this game it had me interested,  clearly they had borrowed a few elements from Titanfall (made by ex Call of Duty developers) but it looked like a promising step forward for the franchise. But when it was shown off at the Microsoft press conference it returned to the same old Call of Duty. I might change my mind when I see some more but I don’t have high hopes for the game.

This was a bit of a tease for me; I loved the Fable franchise until some of the more recent entries and when they started to show off a next gen multiplayer Fable I got really excited. Then they revealed another player planting traps & enemies and I soon realized this wasn’t a full Fable game.  Don’t tease me like that Microsoft.

I don’t really have much to say about this one other than, why Microsoft? Do we really need a reboot of a franchise that nobody knows about? I mean this game didn’t even sell that well when it was originally released in 2004 so why do we need a remake?

Ubisoft had a relatively strong press conference in my opinion. Assassins Creed Unity, Far Cry 4, The Divison, Rainbow 6 Siege & a few others. But they felt it’d be necessary to have some random fitness game in middle of all that. We’re finally coming out of the fitness mad zone that we entered with the Wii & apparently some people are still holding on. Please stop Ubisoft, focus on what you’re good at.
