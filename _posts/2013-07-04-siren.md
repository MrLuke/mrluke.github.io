As some of you might know errors can be a real bitch to deal with. Sometimes even hard to work out when you have one. So thanks to the great mind of [David Darnes](http://david.darn.es/) I've built a plugin for WordPress that alerts you to when theres an error. If you can see it or not. But this isn't just any alert, it just doesn't tell you theres an error. You get an air raid siren play whenever theres an alert on the page. You better fix that bug fast!

If you want to download it I have made it open source like the rest of my projects. Feel free to download & have a play with it. You can find the link here. [Siren Plugin](https://github.com/MrLuke/Siren).
