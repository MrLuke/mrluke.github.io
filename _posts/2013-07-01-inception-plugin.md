title: "Inception Plugin"
---

So a few weeks back myself & [Robert Rhoades](http://studioromeo.co.uk/) decided we wanted to make a fun plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).
We had a few ideas but decided to go with the [Inception plugin](https://github.com/MrLuke/inception_plugin). If any of you aren't familar with Inception theres a piece of nessercary dubstep that plays every so often. So I found an audio file and created a widget for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) which enabled the audio to be played when clicked on a button that appeared in the side bar. 

It did envolve before it turned into its final form. With help from [Matt Kersley](http://mattkersley.com/) my friendly javascript wizard we built it so on click of a specific class it'd play the sound. So if you want to download it and install it please do so! let me know what you think. You'll find a menu in the backend of WordPress which allows you to set a class/id, then when someone clicks on that class/id it'll play the sound. 

Have fun!
