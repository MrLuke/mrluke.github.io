So a few weeks ago I got into [Parks & Recreation](http://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation/). It's pretty much the Parks & Rec department of the goverment doing there day to day job but the personality of each character and the situations they get in make it one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. One character that really stood out was [Ron Swanson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwGat4i8pJI). He's the head of the department and doesn't care about anything. He has some fantastic comments throughout the show so I thought why not make a soundboard of these? So I did! 

You can find it here. [Ron Swanson Soundboard](http://lukereid.me/swanson-soundboard/). 

Any fans of the show I hope you like it! if you don't know the show have a listen anyway. I highly recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it.
