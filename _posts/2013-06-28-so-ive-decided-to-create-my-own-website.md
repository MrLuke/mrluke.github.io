So I've decided to create my own website... 

I've looked at different projects to start, do I start a new plugin? after all I could look into gateways and shipping extensions. I could start that [Anchor](http://anchorcms.com/) theme I wanted to create. After my recent experience creating the [Swanson Soundboard](http://mrluke.github.io/swanson-soundboard/) in [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) I decided I'd like to explore it some more. If I was going to create a website using it, why not make my own website using it? 

With the help of [Robert Rhoades](http://studioromeo.co.uk/) I started to create the site. For now I wanted to create a clean site, nothing overly complicated. A blog was the perfect thing for me now whilst I design the rest of the site. I looked at [Site Inspire](http://www.siteinspire.com/) to get some ideas on colour schemes, layouts and features I'd like to include for now. I got a few ideas, mocked up a very basic simple design in Photoshop with my basic skills. The next thing I know here I am! writing my first post. 

I'll be updating the site on a regular basis hopefully, giving my thoughts on the world of coding, gaming, music and my other interests. During the course of the website I will be including easter eggs so keep an eye out!
