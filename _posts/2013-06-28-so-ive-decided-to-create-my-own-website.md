So I've decided to create my own website... 

I've looked at different projects to start, do I start a new plugin? after all I could look into gateways and shipping extensions. I could start that [Anchor](http://anchorcms.com/) theme I wanted to create. After my recent experience creating the [Swanson Soundboard](http://mrluke.github.io/swanson-soundboard/) in [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) I decided I'd like to explore it some more. If I was going to create a website using it, why not make my own website using it? 

With the help of [Robert Rhoades](http://studioromeo.co.uk/) I started to create the site.
